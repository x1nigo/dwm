# x1nigo's build of dwm
This is my custom build of the suckless window manager.

This particular build is meant to be used in conjunction with the other suckless programs. This includes st, dmenu, and one of the user-created builds of dwmblocks.

## Patches
- [alpha](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/) (transparency and fixes weird borders)
- [alwayscenter](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alwayscenter/) (floating windows spawn at the center)
- [swallow](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swallow/) (window swallowing)
- [vanitygaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/vanitygaps/) (lots of options for gaps)
