# dwm
My build of the suckless window manager.

This particular build is meant to be used in conjunction with the other suckless programs. This includes st, dmenu, and one of the user-created builds of dwmblocks.

NOTE: You need to install libxft-bgra from the AUR since this build uses colored emojis, and dwm (unpatched) doesn't allow this.
